<main><md><p>This document will contain all information about how incoming requests are handled in Kvarn.</p>
<p>This is here to make development easier; to have a clear plan of what to do, where to implement it, and the branching of functions.</p>
<h1 id="layer-1--transport">Layer 1 / Transport</h1>
<p>This is the layer managing the transport layer of the connections. Currently, it’s not implemented, but that should be easy (said that before, haven’t you?).</p>
<p>This is needed for HTTP/3 with its QUIC protocol.</p>
<p>TCP will not get effected.</p>
<h1 id="layer-2--encryption">Layer 2 / Encryption</h1>
<p>This is where encryption takes place, or not. TLS will be processed here.</p>
<p>Unencrypted HTTP will be passed through.</p>
<p>Request is still a stream.</p>
<h1 id="layer-3--http">Layer 3 / HTTP</h1>
<p>This is where all HTTP versions (1, 2 and 3) are managed to give a common API.</p>
<p>Here, the compressed headers of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 are resolved.</p>
<p>Body still stream
(at least kinda, see <a href="https://doc.kvarn.org/kvarn/application/enum.Body.html"><code>application.rs#Body</code></a> for more info).
Headers are parsed.</p>
<h1 id="layer-4--caching-and-compression">Layer 4 / Caching and compression</h1>
<p>All outgoing data from this layer is cached based on the output of <a href="#layer-5--pathing">layer 5</a>.</p>
<p>Rules can be created to get hits from other pages (the Prime extensions) when accessing a page; server-side redirecting, above the caching level.</p>
<p>Compression can be <code>None</code> or <code>Full</code> to regulate automatic caching.</p>
<p>Caching has two options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.kvarn.org/kvarn/comprash/enum.ClientCachePreference.html">Client cache</a>,
<code>None</code> (<code>no-store</code>), <code>Changing</code> (2 minutes), <code>Full</code> (2 years)</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.kvarn.org/kvarn/comprash/enum.ServerCachePreference.html">Server cache</a>,
<code>None</code>, <code>QueryMatters</code> (requested path has to match query) or <code>Full</code> (query of path is ignored, to prevent DDOS attacks circumventing the <em>fast</em> cache)</li>
</ul>
<p>After the response is created by <a href="#layer-5--pathing">layer 5</a>, Present extensions are run here.</p>
<p>Then, each time the response is sent, Package extensions are run.</p>
<p>After the response has been sent, Post extensions are resolved.</p>
<h1 id="layer-5--pathing">Layer 5 / Pathing</h1>
<p>This is where the data of <code>::http::Request</code> is interpreted to either read a file, run a Prepare extension, call PHP, or any <em>path</em>.</p>
<p>This whole layer can be customised, to for example implement a proxy. You have complete control over the outgoing data 
(except for the first response; this is a HTTP server!), cache method, and suggested compression.</p>
<h2 id="layer-6--lib-api">Layer 6 / Lib API</h2>
<p>Only meant to be used from <a href="#layer-5--pathing">layer 5</a>.</p>
<p>This translates header values to more helpful structs, such as <code>accept*</code> and <code>authentication</code>
Can be found using Kvarns public API, through the module <code>utils</code>.</p>
<p>This will get a face-lift in v.0.4.0!</p>
