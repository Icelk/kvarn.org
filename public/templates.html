[dependencies][md-imports][close-head][navigation]
<main><md><p>A goal of the Kvarn web server is to be modular. It’s also designed to be <em>fast</em>. Therefore, some default tools are provided to give good performance. You can naturally write other tools with the same level of integration as the Kvarn-branded ones.</p>
<p>Kvarn’s templating engine works using a <a href="extensions/#present">present extension</a> to expand template names.
The extension takes arguments of which templates to include (e.g. <code>!&gt; tmpl standard.html markdown.html</code>).
It reads those files in the <code>templates/&lt;template file&gt;</code>. <code>templates/</code> is a sibling of the <code>public</code> directory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This system also works for other file types. The same pattern of template files (preferably with the same extension as the file being templated) and present extensions works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can define templates (in e.g. <code>templates/standard.html</code>) using names inside brakets: <code>[template name]</code>. Everything after the template name (a space or newline is required after) is part of that template.</p>
<p>In your document, include templates by writing their name in brackets the same was as described above. The text will be “copy and pasted” to override the template.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The template definitions and usages can be indented. This allows for formatting tools to be ran.</p>
