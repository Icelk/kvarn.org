Right now, you'll have to use Kvarn as a library, and recompile it every time you change something.
This is slow, and unintuitive for new users.

Some time soon, the reference implementation will develop a plain text config format,
rendering recompilation obsolete.

You can naturally still embed Kvarn in your application after this, but the *reference* will be easier to use.

This page will then show you how to use the config.
