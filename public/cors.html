<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>CORS stands for <em>cross-origin resource sharing</em>. As the name implies, it allows websites to use resources from other websites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is heavily used by larger websites to serve static content (e.g. images, video) from <em>content delivery networks</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The protections CORS enforces are critical. Letâ€™s say a malicious actor, Ted, wants to get money from you. In a world without CORS, Ted could issue a request on your browser to your bank and transfer money.</p>
