<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>CORS stands for <em>cross-origin resource sharing</em>. As the name implies, it allows
websites to use resources from other websites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is heavily used by larger websites to serve static content (e.g. images,
video) from <em>content delivery networks</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The protections CORS enforces are critical. Let’s say a malicious actor, Ted,
wants to get money from you. In a world without CORS, Ted could issue a request
on your browser to your bank and transfer money. CORS protects against this by
telling the browser “if anyone tries to send you to any website but these
listed, refuse”. This mainly helps against XSS attacks, when a hacker injects
code into your front-end.</p>
<h1 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h1>
<p>When you have a legitimate reason to interact with other websites, you have to

to the
<a href="https://doc.kvarn.org/kvarn/cors/type.Cors.html">list of accepted sites</a>. Here,
you can specify which
<a href="https://doc.kvarn.org/kvarn/cors/struct.AllowList.html">methods and headers</a>
are valid for sending to the third party.</p>
