<main><md><p>Kvarn offers a built in cache with cache invalidation based on <code>cache-control</code>; <code>kvarn-cache-control</code> headers; and an <a href="https://doc.kvarn.org/kvarn/comprash/enum.ServerCachePreference.html">enum</a>.</p>
<p>When creating a <a href="https://doc.kvarn.org/kvarn/struct.FatResponse.html">response</a>, you choose how the server caches it.</p>
<h1 id="query-behaviour">Query behaviour</h1>
<p>The cache only caches responses with differing queries if the implementation demands.</p>
<p>This is due to performance reasons - if the query was to be cache, an attacker could send multiple queries and saturate the cache.
We’re actively investigating how to improve on this.</p>
<h1 id="cache-invalidation">Cache invalidation</h1>
<p>The invalidation is <em>lazy</em> - it removes items only when trying to fetch them and they’re old.
We might change this in the future, to an active system, where a Tokio timer would be triggered for each new cache item, removing it after the timeout.
That would be more memory-efficient. I however prefer the lazy approach, as that’s similar to how the standard library handles collections - it never removes items.</p>
<h1 id="relation-to-http-status-codes">Relation to HTTP status codes</h1>
<p>Certain status codes are <a href="https://doc.kvarn.org/kvarn/host/fn.default_status_code_cache_filter.html">not cached</a>.
This is due to the nature of responses - if the server rejects a client due to an invalid request, that shouldn’t be returned to everybody.</p>
<h1 id="limits">Limits</h1>
<p>The cache is limited by both size and count of responses.</p>
<h1 id="file-system-cache">File system cache</h1>
<p>As noted by the functions in <a href="https://doc.kvarn.org/kvarn/read/"><code>kvarn::read</code></a>, files are typically cached.</p>
<p>You should use the caching function if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the resource is hot, the response isn’t cached, but data on the filesystem doesn’t change often.</li>
<li>you’re using the same files on the FS in an API (while not caching responses).</li>
</ul>
<p>In all other cases, don’t use the FS cache, as responses are cached.</p>
