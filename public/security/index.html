<main><md><p>A web-server needs good security practises to
avoid
leaking data,
allowing unauthenticated API calls,
or go offline due to a DOS attacks.</p>
<p>Kvarn is built on top of these principles to provide security out of the box.</p>

<h1 id="cors"><a href="/cors.">CORS</a></h1>
<p>Kvarn allows for easy configuration of CORS settings, reducing the risk of a vulnerable API,
in the case of a third party website suffering from XSS.</p>
<h1 id="rust">Rust</h1>
<p>Kvarn is entirely written in Rust, a memory-safe language without a noticeable runtime penalty.
This removes the risk of buffer overflows, dangling pointers, and other undefined behaviour.</p>
<p>Not only the library, but also extensions (the code you write) are protected against this.</p>
<h1 id="internal-api">Internal API</h1>
<p>To reduce risks of faulty code, Kvarn abstracts several concepts of unsecure things.
This eliminates the risk of exposing data.</p>
<p>The response cache is stored in memory and never on disk.</p>
<h2 id="strict-request-checks">Strict request checks</h2>
<p>When a request is parsed, certain components are analyzed to be legal.
This guarantees only files from the webroot are available (as long as your extensions don’t read any other).</p>
<h2 id="file-structure">File structure</h2>
<p>The public files, certificates, error messages, and templates are in separate folders, independent from each other.</p>
<h1 id="limiting"><a href="/limiting.">Limiting</a></h1>
<p>To prevent malicious actors from taking your site down, two layers of defense are implemented by default.
If a IP overrides a configured threshold of requests, it’ll receive a error message until the timer is reset.</p>
<h1 id="testing">Testing</h1>
<p>Everybody makes mistakes.
A solid testing library and solid tests for a library can prevent pushing faulty code to prod.</p>
<p>Kvarn provides an easy-to-use testing library for integration testing your Kvarn extensions and your API.
It’s also covered by tests validating logic, speed, and stability of Kvarn’s code.</p>
<h1 id="few-lines-of-code">Few lines of code</h1>
<p>If we assume the act of programming is to introduce bugs, less code should mean less bugs.</p>
<p>The entirety of Kvarn, including the optional extensions, and it’s reference implementation is less than 10K SLOC;
the whole codebase can be audited in a day.</p>
